## Steps To Run Project Locally

1. Clone the repo using this link: `https://github.com/Amer15/log-monitoring.git`
2. Open the project in your code editor.
3. Open two terminals:
   - One inside the `frontend/` folder
   - One inside the `backend/` folder
4. Install dependencies in both terminals:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Create a `.env` file inside the **backend** folder with the following content:
   ```env
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   ```
6. Create a `.env` file inside the **frontend** folder with the following content:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASEURL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```
7. Run both frontend and backend apps in their respective terminals:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
8. Thatâ€™s it! Now open the frontend app in your browser to:
   - View logs  
   - Add new logs  
   - Apply filters (level, message, resourceId, and timestamp range)
